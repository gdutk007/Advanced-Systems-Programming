    /*           Case 1
   for case 1  the device driver 
   seems to be locking semaphore 2 and not 
   releasing it before exiting during open(). Opening 
   the driver several times will cause 
   the locked semaphore to deadlock. 

     -The first open will take the lock
     - The second open will get blocked. 
     - Since the second open is blocking, 
     the third open never gets called. The 
     threads stay waiting on the semaphore 
     that never gets released.
