    /*           Case 2
        for case 2 we will have two threads and the deadlock happens 
        when switching from mode 1 to mode 2. 
        - First we open the driver twice, this will block 
        on the second open. 
        - When we block on the second open, we switch back 
        to thread 1 and try to use ioctl to switch to mode 2. 
        - When we try to switch to mode 2 we have to wait until 
        (devc->count1 == 1) so we start to block again. 
        - While blocking and waiting for (devc->count1 == 1) we switch 
        back to the other thread which is still blocked waiting for 
        semaphore 2 to become unlocked.
