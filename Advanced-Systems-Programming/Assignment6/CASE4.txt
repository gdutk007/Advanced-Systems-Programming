    /*           Case 3
        For this third case two threads will try and switch their modes. 

        While trying to switch modes there can be a case where both 
        threads are left waiting for locks 1 and 2 to be released. This 
        will never happen under the following scenerio. 

           - The first thread will open the driver and switch its mode to mode 2 and sleep. 
           - The second thread will then open the driver and lock semaphore 2.
           - Then thread 2 will try to switch to mode 1, but will block trying to lock 
           sempahore 2 because open() already locked it. 
           - Now because we block trying to switch back to mode 1, we will be back in thread
           1. Thread 1 will try to switch the mode to mode 1 and will fail because thread 2 
           has locked sempahores 1 and 2 when trying to switch its mode.
